# HW02 â€“ Decision Trees, Bagging, and Boosting

This notebook implements tree based machine learning methods on the HIGGS dataset to classify particle collision events as either signal (Higgs boson) or background.

## Dataset

A cleaned version of the HIGGS dataset is used. Features with high multicollinearity were removed using VIF analysis from HW01.
